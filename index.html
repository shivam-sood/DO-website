  <p>Programs like PowerPoint, Keynote, and Adobe Illustrator are common tools for
designing posters, but these programs have a number of disadvantages, including
lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation">separation of content and presentation</a> and lack of
programmatic control over the output. Designing posters using these programs
can require countless hours calculating positions of elements by hand, manually
laying out content, manually propagating style changes, and repeating these
kinds of tasks over and over again during the iterative process of poster
design.</p>

<p>The idea of using a document preparation system like <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to implement a
poster using code sounds fantastic, and indeed, there are a number of LaTeX
<a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/cat/conference-posters">templates</a> and packages for making posters, such as <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/a0poster">a0poster</a>, <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/sciposter">sciposter</a>,
and <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/beamerposter">beamerposter</a>. However, I didn’t like the look of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=latex+poster+template&amp;tbm=isch">existing</a> themes
and templates — they all looked 20 years old — and this is what kept me
from using LaTeX for making posters, even though I had been using the software
for years for authoring documents.</p>

<p>I finally bit the bullet and spent some time designing a clean, stylish, and
minimal poster theme for LaTeX, building on top of the beamerposter package.
The result has been open-sourced as <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini">Gemini</a>, and it makes it really easy to
design posters that look like <a href="/media/2018/07/19/poster.pdf">this</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/media/2018/07/19/poster.png" alt="Poster example" /></p>

<div id="x-continue-reading"></div>

<h1 id="why-latex">Why LaTeX?</h1>

<p>There are a number of programs commonly used for making academic posters. These
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Word processing programs (e.g. Word, Pages, and LibreOffice Writer)</li>
  <li>Presentation programs (e.g. PowerPoint, Keynote, and LibreOffice Impress)</li>
  <li>Vector editing programs (e.g. Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape)</li>
</ul>

<p>Why use LaTex over these programs? The biggest benefit is that LaTeX does not
require manual effort to lay out contents and apply a uniform style to the
entire poster. All layout and styling is done using code relying on TeX’s
sophisticated layout algorithms, and there is a clean separation of content and
presentation, similar to the content/style separation in HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>There are other benefits as well. TeX is a sophisticated typesetting system
that produces excellent results for text as well as mathematical formulae;
LaTeX packages provide support for <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots?lang=en">plotting</a> and algorithmically
specified <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf">diagrams and vector graphics</a>; and beamer provides support for
column-based layout, including variable-width and nested columns. This means
that all content in the poster, not just the text, can be produced using code:
no more screenshots of mathematical equations; no more positioning shapes with
the mouse to create diagrams; no more screenshots of plots where the styling
doesn’t quite match the style of the poster; and no more manual positioning of
blocks.</p>

<h1 id="a-modern-latex-poster-theme">A modern LaTeX poster theme</h1>

<p>Building posters with LaTeX is by far a better experience than using
PowerPoint, Keynote, or Illustrator. I felt that the one thing missing was an
aesthetically pleasing poster theme. There’s no reason a poster designed using
LaTeX should look any less beautiful than a poster made using graphic design
software like Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>This is what led to the creation of <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini">Gemini</a>, a LaTex poster theme with a focus
on being clean, minimal, and looking great out of the box while being
customizable:</p>

<p><img src="/media/2018/07/19/poster-gemini.png" alt="Gemini default theme example" /></p>

<p><img src="/media/2018/07/19/poster-mit.png" alt="MIT theme example" /></p>

<p>The theme is actually a pretty small amount of code; most of the functionality
is provided by LaTeX and beamerposter. But making conscious choices on title
and block layout, font families, font weights, color schemes, and other little
details makes a pretty big difference in how the poster looks and feels.</p>
